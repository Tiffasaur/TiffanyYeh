              <p align="justify"> <b> Moonshiner </b> is an independent cinema of the restaurant/lifestle chain WXY in Taipei, Taiwan. The cinema, which seats around 60 people, hosts weekly screenings that uncover hidden gems of the silver screen. As a manager of the cinema, I hand-selected films each month, from Xavier Dolan's "Mommy" to the reclaimed titles cf Stanley Kubrick. The cinema was a space where indie and classic films alike could shine and be revisited, discovered, and enjoyed by cinephiles.
                <br>
				<br> <b> Social Media </b> was the main channel used by the cinema to communicate and interact with its audiences. For every film we screened, significant effort was put into creating engaging content on facebook to generate interest drive sales.

				<br> <b> Campaign for "Mommmy" </b>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					<center> <img src="../images/content_BusinessNManagement/Mommy Music.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"> </center>
					<br> We turned Mother's Day into Mother's Month and screened films that centered on the complicated and profound relationships between mother and children. The main movie we promoted was "Mommy" by Quebec director Xavier Dolan. Posts that introduced the director,who was widely popular among niche audiences, were posted daily. On top of that, a playlist that featured the songs from the film was posted and updated daily to inspire people and get them to envision the atmosphere created in the film. Audiences were encouraged to bring family with them to the screening, with people who brought their mothers receiving bonus discounts and prizes.

				<b> Campaign For Earth Day </b>
				</p>
				<p align="justify">
					<br> <center> <img src="../images/content_BusinessNManagement/Plastic Ocean.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"> </center>
					<br> For Earth day we screened movies that focused on Mother Earth and the need for us to take action to protect it. I crafted posts that drew people's attention to the dire circumstances our environment is under while daily posts revealed interesting, beautiful, and fascinating facts about nature. Film recommendations were also given to encourage people to educate themselves and understand the challenges our Earth faces through the critical lens of documentary filmmakers. For the month, anyone who brought in a water bottle to refill at the branch would receive a coupon for coffee with their cinema ticket.

				<b> Easter Egg Campaign </b>
				</p>
				<p>
					<br> <center> <img src="../images/content_BusinessNManagement/Score.jpg" alt="" class="img-fluid"> </center>
					<br> For the lead up to the screening of "The Shining", a favorite among indie film watchers, an "Easter Egg Challenge" was launched in anticipation of the screening. 
					The Shining was known to have many hidden messages as well as being a film that many films pay hommage to. The film was a cultural phenomenom and the game was created to honor movies that have truly impacted audiences and filmmakers alike. Posts that featured scenes in movies were posted each day and participants (our followers) were asked to guess which famous movie the post was referring to. 
					A scoreboard was kept to keep participants updated on how well they are doing and a prize was given to the top three players. The game was a huge success, as it really appealed to people who loved movies, old and new, and had them discussing with fellow cinema-goes on what the answers were. The campaign became one of our most popular posts and tickets were all sold out for the screenings.
